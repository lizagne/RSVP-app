## RSVP app from Treehouse tutorial

Working through a tutorial from Treehouse. This helped me to understand better the CRUD (Create, read, update and delete) system. They are the four basic functions of persistent storage. Treehouse takes you through each stage step by step. The styling was already done, and I followed along with the tutorial as I was pretty new to Redux at this stage.
